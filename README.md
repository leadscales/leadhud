# About:

LeadHUD is a modern, functional HUD for Team Fortress 2, taking inspiration from modern FPS games.

LeadHUD is still work in progress and will remain so for a while. Plans are to have almost every element customized and to fit in with the current style of the HUD.

# Installation:

Clone the repo with git or download the zip manually, extract it, and drag and drop the **leadhud-main** folder into the /tf/custom/ folder.

# Crosshairs

This HUD has custom crosshair support. By default, they act as a hitmarker, but can be changed to function like a normal crosshair. Check the hudlayout.res file for more info.

# Streamer Mode

This HUD has streamer mode support, which hides player names and makes a cursory attempt at making you anonymous. You can activate it with `streamer_mode` in the console or by using the in-game button.
